Version	notes
0.0.1	Initial implementation of the app taking name of reactors, manual and PioReactor OD readings. These are used to calibrate raw ODs from PioReactors using a linear regression model.
0.0.2	Add the option to give only initial and final manual OD values and name of reactor, the app will then take a set of readings from start and end of bioreactor ODs as the corresponding ODs to the manual readings.
0.0.3	Increase of the size allowed to be uploaded to the app. Maximum file size set to: options(shiny.maxRequestSize = 100*1024^2) (100 MB). This fix comes from: https://shiny.posit.co/r/articles/build/upload/
0.0.4	Added 'simplify=F' to the sapply() function of pioreactor_unit names in the output data frame of write_calibrate_od_to_pio_format, to prevent multiple columns with pioreactor names.
